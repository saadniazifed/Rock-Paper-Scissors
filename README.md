## Rock-Paper-Scissors
A fully functional Rock Paper Scissors game which can be played against the Computer.

The third project in the Foundation section of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

Spec and details for the assignment can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) and [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors)

Play online in [The Browser](https://saadniazifed.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/)

## Features

* Player vs The Computer.
* First project which uses console.log in its first iteration to play the game.
* In the second iteration, DOM Manipulation is used to play the game vs the computer. 
* The game contains basic CSS styling.
* It contains 5 rounds you can play with the computer. First one to win 5 rounds will be declared the winner.

## How to use

Play online in [The Browser](https://saadniazifed.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/)
To start playing, select one of the three options from Rock, Paper and Scissors.
The computer will select its own choice and a result will be determined.
First one to reach 5 rounds wins.

## Possible future additions

None that I can find. Project is completed as it is.

### UI / UX
* It only involves button click and the DOM changing the message based on the result and user's selected choice.
* DOM changes the div result once the winner is selected.

## Known Bugs
None. Everything was fixed before deployment.

## Reflections
DOM Manipulation was the toughest concept for me to grasp as it was new at the time. But, after reading Digital Ocean's blog post
DOM Manipulation and practicing it on this project, I now have a firm grasp on it.
